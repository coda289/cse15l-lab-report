2. ssh<space>dbarnhardt@ieng6.ucsd.edu<enter>
3. ssh is saying I want to log into a secure shell and after that is my username for the ieng6 machine. then I hit enter to run the command and I do not need to type in a password because I delt with that in a previous lab.
## Step 5

2. git<space>clone<space>`crtlV`
3. git is saying that it is a git command. clone is cloning a repository onto the ieng6 machine. and the url is the url of the repository i am cloning. I pasted the url to the repo with ctr v.
## Step 6

2. cd <space> l <tab> <enter>
   bash <space> t <tab>
4. cd changes directories and lab7 is the directory i want to change into then enter to change into it. then bash runs a script so run multiple lines of code at once and test.sh is a script that compiles and runs and runs the junit tests. i used tab so i didnt have to type the whole name of the file/directory and instead let the computer complete it. 
## Step 7

2. vim <space> Li <tab> . <tab> <enter>
<down>x44 w w <left>x2 r2 :wq <enter>
3. vim with a file, here i typed the first letters and filled it in with tab, will open up a file in vim editor when I hot enter. Then i held the down arrow until I got to the line i wanted to change. then i hit w twice to get to the start of the word after the one i wanted to chnage. the i hit the left arrow to get to the charcater i wanted to change. then i hit r for replace and 2 as the thing i wanted to replace it with. then :wq after you hit enter saves and exits the vim editor. 
## Step 8
1. <img width="342" alt="image" src="https://github.com/coda289/cse15l-lab-report/assets/148298382/920c25d5-4b66-4b04-aa25-fbe595519ef1">
2. <up> <up> <enter>
3. hitting the up arrow once brings you to the last command you ran. hitting it again brings you to the one before that, for me that was the correct command. and after i reached the correct command i hit enter and it is the same file ran with bash to run the junit tests. 
## Step 9

2. git <space> add <space> . <enter>
git <space> com<tab> -m <space> "fix <space> index" <enter>
git <space> push <space> o<tab> m<tab> <enter>
3. git add . this will add the files to the repository and the period serves as a wildcard
   the next line it to commit your changes and lock them into place in addition to adding a message that wil go along with the changes. I chose fix index because that is what i did.
   the next line pushes the actual changes onto git hub.
