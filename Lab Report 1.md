# Lab Report 1
## `cd` examples
1. no arguements
```
dakot@DESKTOP-2TDL2AN MINGW64 ~/lecture1 (main)
$ cd

dakot@DESKTOP-2TDL2AN MINGW64 ~
```
**absolute path:** `/c/Users/dakot/lecture1`

Because I had no arguements there was no output but the directory changed to my directory.

It is not an error because the code has no output and executed correctly

2. path to directory
```
dakot@DESKTOP-2TDL2AN MINGW64 ~
$ cd lecture1

dakot@DESKTOP-2TDL2AN MINGW64 ~/lecture1 (main)
```
**absolute path:** `/c/Users/dakot/`

With the argument `lecture 1` I got no arguement but my directory changed to `lecture 1`

This is not an error because this is the intended use of cd. To change from one directory to the other.
